node rootExternalCA


note top of rootExternalCA
Suppose this is the root CA of your organization that is trusted
within the organization on every device, from the edge up to 
the server.
You don't need to have a read access to the private key
of this CA. You just need to be able to sign the intermediate leaf CA.
If you have the root CA trusted within an organization, you won't need
to tackle with annoying HTTPs issues showing up in a browser.

node (ManySignedIdentities)

note top of ManySignedIdentities
The ziti controller has to have an access some intermediate CA
to be able to sign off certs for identities.
You could have one intermediate CA to control everything, for eg
just openzitiICA.
But this way if the controller node is compromised you would vulnerable
for the total loss of trust and you would have to re-issue the whole pki.
